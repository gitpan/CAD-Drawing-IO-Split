Requisite Plug-in Functions
    See CAD::Drawing::IO for a description of the plug-in architecture.

  check_type

    Returns true if $type is "split" or $filename is a directory (need a
    tag?)

      $fact = check_type($filename, $type);

Load/Save Methods
    Concept here is to strip data down to the absolute bare minumum in an
    effort to find a generic and extensible incarnation of same.

  save

    Saves data into $toplevel_directory under a directory for each layer,
    each type, and a file for each id.

      save($drw, $toplevel_directory, \%options);

    Selective saves not yet supported.

    Unfortunately, the file-formats are rather primitive and the code needs
    refactoring. These are nowhere near stable, so don't expect version
    compatibility yet!

    Needs a clear_all_like => $regex option.

  load

      load($drw, $toplevel_directory, \%options);

    %options may include selective-load arguments

Naming Functions
  _dir_list

      @list = _dir_list($dir);

  _sp_filename

    Creates nested directories which are required to save %obj and returns
    the filename which should be saved into.

      _sp_filename(\%obj, \%data);

Inherited Methods
  clear_dir

    Removes layers (and items) from the split directory $dir.

    Defaults to removing all.

      $drw->clear_dir($dir, \%options);

    Available options:
      like    => qr/regex/,  # if regex matches layer name
      not_like => qr/regex/,  # negative of above (compounded)

    check_select() options:
    %options is passed through CAD::Drawing::Defined::check_select(), so the
    selections returned by it will be utilized here.

      select_layers => \@layer_list,
      select_types => \@types_list,

    Returns the number of items removed or undef() if $dir does not exist.
